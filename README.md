## Overview

This is a Working Draft of the Specification for Knowledge Graph, a language for
describing a general graph structure used in commercial application

The target audience for this specification is not the client developer, but
those who have, or are actively interested in, building their own Graph-related
implementations and tools.

In order to be broadly adopted, Knowledge Graph will have to target a wide
variety of backend environments, frameworks, and languages, which will
necessitate a collaborative effort across projects and organizations. This
specification serves as a point of coordination for this effort.
